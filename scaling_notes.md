# Scaling Strategy

## 1. Microservices Architecture
- Split job execution, job creation, and job querying into separate services
- Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) to decouple components

## 2. Database Scaling
- Use PostgreSQL for better concurrency and horizontal scaling
- Apply read replicas and connection pooling

## 3. API Load Management
- Deploy behind an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, NGINX)
- Use rate limiting, authentication middleware

## 4. Job Scheduler Scaling
- Use distributed job queues (e.g., Celery + Redis)
- Run multiple scheduler workers with a shared job backend

## 5. Deployment
- Containerize with Docker
- Orchestrate with Kubernetes (auto-scaling enabled)

## 6. Observability
- Integrate with Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and alerting
- Log with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
